QPULSECAPTURE	
=========================================================================================

PG.pro should be maked with QPULSECAPTURE\ForVPG branch.

This branch "ForVPG" was created especcially for VPG project and it contains only
few modules from original repo. This modules provide only basic functionality and do not
provide interfaces to many options.
